# Deep Learning Lab Repository (Subject Code: 21BSDA5C52L)

Welcome to the Deep Learning Lab Repository for the 5th Semester B.Sc Data Science students. In this repository, you will find a collection of code examples, small projects, and resources related to the subject of Deep Learning.

## Repository Structure

- **Classwork:** This folder contains code examples and codes discussed during classwork sessions. These examples are designed to help you understand and implement various concepts of deep learning.
- **Labs:** The main directory hosts lab codes for different deep learning experiments. Lab codes will be organized into separate folders based on the respective lab sessions (e.g., Lab 1, Lab 2, etc.).

## How to Use This Repository

- To access classwork code examples, navigate to the `Classwork` folder. Each example will have its own directory containing the code, a brief explanation, and any required datasets.
- Lab codes will be available in the `Main` directory after the completion of each lab session. You can find them organized into folders corresponding to the lab sessions.
